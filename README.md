# cron-job-timeline
A simple webpage that shows when your manually entered cron jobs run. It updates in real time so you can see what's running now, what just ran, and what's coming up.

All data is managed via a json file with data edited in manually. It does not automatically fill in data from a crontab. 

It supports separating cronjobs via different servers, colors and timezone offsets. See example json file.
